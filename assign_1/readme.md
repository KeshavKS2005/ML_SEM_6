\# Machine Learning Algorithms Laboratory – Exploratory Data Analysis \& Classification



\\



\## 1. Project Workflow Overview



Each notebook follows a consistent workflow:



1\. Dataset loading and inspection  

2\. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  

3\. Statistical analysis of features  

4\. Visualization using plots and heatmaps  

5\. Identification of ML task
